    "MongoDB is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON. It is designed to handle large-scale, unstructured, and rapidly changing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not follow the traditional relational database model with fixed table schemas, rows, and columns. Instead, they allow for flexible and dynamic data models that can evolve over time, making them well-suited for handling diverse and complex data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling large-scale, unstructured data: MongoDB is designed to store and handle large volumes of unstructured data, such as social media posts, sensor data, multimedia content, and user-generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agile and iterative development: MongoDB's flexible schema allows developers to easily iterate and evolve the data model during the development process without disrupting the application's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time analytics and insights: MongoDB supports real-time data processing and analysis, making it suitable for use cases where real-time analytics and insights are critical, such as in the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability and high availability: MongoDB's distributed architecture allows for horizontal scalability, making it capable of handling high levels of read and write loads. It also has built-in features for replication and automatic failover, ensuring high availability and data durability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility in data modeling: MongoDB's document-oriented model allows for flexible and dynamic data modeling, enabling storage of complex data structures, nested arrays, and documents with varying fields, making it suitable for use cases where data is diverse and dynamic."
